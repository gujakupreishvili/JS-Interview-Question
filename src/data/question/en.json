    "question":"What is React?",
    "answer": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture, where each component manages its own state and can be reused across the application. React updates the UI efficiently using a Virtual DOM, re-rendering only the parts that change. Its declarative approach makes it easier to design and maintain interactive, dynamic web applications."
